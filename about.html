    Who are we? What  is our purpose?
  </main>
  <p class="dtext">We are a group of people who are simply tired of not getting the food we deserve in school. The food served at lunch should be able to give us enough energy for the whole day. We came together from the same class and started this movement because we didn’t see enough of a change happen and we wanted to take it in our own hands. So far we believe we have made a big difference in the way that more people are aware of the problem and hopefully take it more seriously. We hope in the near future that this isn’t a problem anymore and if you feel like you can help in any way make sure to reach out to us and tell us your plan! Everyone’s welcome!
