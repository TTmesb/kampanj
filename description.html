    What is this campaign? How can it help you?
  </main>
  <p class="dtext">This campaign is about how we believe the food served in most schools is worse than what we all deserve. Skolverket should do something about this and they are absolutely in the position to do so. It’s not always the money that is the problem and the cost of the food, but how it’s cooked. If we make sure the food is cooked correctly we can save money from not throwing away food that’s not eatable and by saving on that we also save on the point that we don’t have to buy as much food from the start. How the situation is right now some people are not eating lunch because they dislike it and it’s not good food. That causes a lot of problems not only for the health of the students and how they don’t get the nutrition they need and also how they perform in school. Students get more tired and can’t focus on the lessons which lead to lower grades in the long run. It’s quite an easy problem to fix we believe and we can definitely make a change happen for the better
